# Inverse_Theory_Bayes_Codes

This repository is a compendium of codes I made during the course "Inverse Problem Theory - A Bayesian Approach".  This course was given by Prof. Klaus Mosegaard, during his visit at ETH in I-2017.

The most interesting results are in the solutions of assignements 4 and 5, where I obtain statistics (histogram and marginal probabilities scanning all possible configurations) from a training image by using a 2x2 moving window. 

Then, i)an initial model is created and ii)conditional probabilities are computed based on the distribution (statistics) of the training image. This allows building a new image by picking random configurations from this distribution.
